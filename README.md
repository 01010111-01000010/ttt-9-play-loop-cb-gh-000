# Tic Tac Toe Play Loop

## Outline

1. Overview. A simple lap that has you implement a play loop method. The method should call turn forever allowing you to entirely fill in the tic tac toe board. we're building a broken version of this method - a very simplified version, like we did with our first display_board.

2. Requirements/Tests

Make sure it loops forever. Should only place Xs. Never stops even if it wins or draws.

3. Starter Code

This lab can come with everything besides the play method I think. Should use code from TTT-7-Turn solution.

4. Instructions.

Read the starter code. Read passing simple tests for starter code.

Stub out a simple play method that says Welcome to the User.
Call that in the bin.

Get that passing.

Then implement the looping play method and test it with your runner or via tests.

5. next steps

What's wrong with this play method?

1. Never ends, no draw or win.
2. Doesn't switch tokens on turn.

What do we need for those?
